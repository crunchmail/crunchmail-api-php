# PHPUnit Tests

## Requirements

To run the Test suite, you will need PHP 5.6+.


## Execute tests

    cd /root/of/project
    phpunit

Or with testdox format:

    phpunit --testdox


This will also generate code coverage and agile testdox in docs/ directory.


See [documentation](--coverage-text=coverage.txt) for more information about
how it works.
