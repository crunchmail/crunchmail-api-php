# Crunchmail-client-php 0.0.1

Official PHP wrapper for Crunchmail API


# Important Notice

This API is **under development**. Do not use in production!


# Install

## Using composer (recommended)

Crunchmail-client uses [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

First [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) if needed.

Then install:

    composer require crunchmail/crunchmail-client-php

## Manually

If you wish to install the client manually, you will need to first install
guzzle 6 and load the libraries yourself, as composer will not handle the
autoload for you in that case.


# Getting started

See [example script](./examples/index.php) to see how to use the API.
